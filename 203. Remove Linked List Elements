Given the head of a linked list and an integer val, remove all the nodes of the linked list that has Node.val == val, and return the new head.

Input: head = [1,2,6,3,4,5,6], val = 6
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]

Solution:
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeElements(self, head: ListNode, val: int) -> ListNode:
        sentinal = ListNode(0)
        sentinal.next = head
        
        prev, curr = sentinal, head
        while curr:
            if curr.val == val:
                prev.next = curr.next
            else:
                prev = curr
            curr = curr.next
            
        return sentinal.next

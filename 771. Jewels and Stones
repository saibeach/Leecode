You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

 

Example 1:

Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0

Solution Alex:
class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, jewels: str, stones: str) -> int:
        res = 0
        for i in jewels:
            for j in stones:
                if i == j:
                    res += 1
        return res
        
Solution:
class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, jewels: str, stones: str) -> int:
        freqs = collections.defaultdict(int)
        count = 0
        
        for stone in stones:
            freqs[stone] += 1
        
        for jewel in jewels:
            if jewel in freqs:
                count += freqs[jewel]
                
        return count

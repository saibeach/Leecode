Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings.

You need to help them find out their common interest with the least list index sum. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer.

Example 1:

Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["Piatti","The Grill at Torrey Pines","Hungry Hunter Steakhouse","Shogun"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The only restaurant they both like is "Shogun".
Example 2:

Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["KFC","Shogun","Burger King"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The restaurant they both like and have the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum 1 (0+1).
Example 3:

Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["KFC","Burger King","Tapioca Express","Shogun"]
Output: ["KFC","Burger King","Tapioca Express","Shogun"]


Solution:

class Solution:
    def findRestaurant(self, list1: List[str], list2: List[str]) -> List[str]:
       
        Aindex = {u: i for i, u in enumerate(list1)}
        best, ans = 1e9, []

        for j, v in enumerate(list2):
            i = Aindex.get(v, 1e9)
            if i + j < best:
                best = i + j
                ans = [v]
            elif i + j == best:
                ans.append(v)
        return ans

Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most one 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0]
Output: 4
Explanation: Flip the first zero will get the maximum number of consecutive 1s. After flipping, the maximum number of consecutive 1s is 4.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 4

solutions:
class Solution:
    def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        pre = -1
        curr = 0
        maxlen = 0
        for n in nums:
            if n == 0:
                pre, curr = curr, 0
            else:
                curr += 1
            maxlen = max(maxlen, pre + 1 + curr)
        return maxlen
